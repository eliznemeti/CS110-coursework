# [5 pts] Task 1 # 

# [5 pts] Fix the Python program. It should use a while loop to count numbers from 1 to 10 and print them correctly. 

count = 1
while count <= 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1 # students need to add this line
    
# [5 pts] Task 2 # 

# Modify the program to count from 1 to 50 but print only the numbers that are divisible by 5 below.
count = 1
while count <= 50:
    if count % 5 == 0:
        print(count)
    count += 1

# [10 pts] Task 3 # 
# Write a Python program that repeatedly asks the user to input an integer until the user enters a negative integer. 
# The program should calculate the sum of (only) the positive numbers entered by the user.

# [1 pts] Create a variable to store the final sum below.
sum = 0

# [1 pts] Create a variable to store the user's input below
user_number = 0  

# [6 pts] Initiate the while loop to ask for user input and accumulate the sum below.
while user_number >= 0:
    user_number = int(input("Enter a positive number (or a negative number to stop): "))
    if user_number >= 0:
        sum += user_number

# [2 pts] Print the total sum, excluding the negative number that stops the loop below.
print("The total sum is:", sum)
