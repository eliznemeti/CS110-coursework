## Temperature Conversions ##

## Exercise 1 - Fahrenheit to Celsius ##

# Ask the user to enter today's temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (make sure it's an integer).

# Convert Fahrenheit input to Celsius using the formula C = (5/9) * (F - 32)

# Display the conversion result using an f-string.


## Exercise 2 - Highs & Lows ##

# Ask the user to enter the highest and lowest temperature in Fahrenheit for Thursday 9/25. (Make sure it's an integer.)

# Convert the inputs into Celsius

# Display the results in Celsius using an f-string. 


## Exercise 3 - Checking the temperature conversion ##

# Ask the user to re-enter the high and low Celsius values they obtained from Exercise 2 (make sure it's a float).

# Convert the Celsius temperatures back to Fahrenheit using the formula F = (9/5) * C + 32

# Calculate the differences between the original F. temperatures (Exercise 2 inputs) and the converted F. temperatures.

# Round the differences to two decimal places

# Display the differences using f-strings - they should be 0.0.
