# [10 pts] Task 1: Calculate Square and Cube using Lambda Functions

# (1 pt) Define the function calculate_square_and_cube that takes an integer n and returns a tuple containing the square and cube of n.

# (2 pts) Define a lambda function to calculate the square of n

# (2 pts) Define a lambda function to calculate the cube of n

# (2 pts) Return a tuple containing both the square and the cube

# (1 pt) Ask the user to input a number

# (2 pts) Call calculate_square_and_cube with the user input and store the result and print the result


# [10 pts] Task 2: Recursive Sum of All Positive Integers Up to a Given Number

# (2 pt) Define the function sum_up_to that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all positive integers up to n using recursion.

# (2 pts) Base case: if n is less than or equal to 0, return 0

# (3 pts) Recursive case: add n to the result of sum_up_to(n - 1)

# (1 pt) Ask the user to input a positive integer

# (2 pts) Call sum_up_to with the user input and store the result and print the result
