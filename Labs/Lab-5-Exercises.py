# For each comparison, print the boolean result. 

# [2 pts] Check if x is less than y.

# [2 pts] Check if x is not equal to y. 

# [2 pts] Check if z is equal to 0. 

# [2 pts] Check if x is greater than or equal to y. 


# [10 pts] Exercise 2: Decision Programs # 

# [1 pts] Prompt the user to enter an integer.

# [4 pts] Use if/else to check whether the integer is a positive or negative number, and print the result with a message.
    
# [1 pts] Prompt the user to enter a new integer.

# [4 pts] Use if/else to now check whether the integer is even or odd, and print the result with a message.
