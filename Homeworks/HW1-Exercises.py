# [10 pts] Question 1.  

# Write a program to print 10, 10.0, “10.0”.  

# Find the type of each and explain the differences between 10, 10.0, and “10.0”. (code + written)



# [15 pts] Question 2. 

# Print the expression that adds two integers, 5 and 10. 

# Concatenate two strings, '5' and '10', and print the result. 

# What is the difference between adding integers and concatenating strings? (written)



# [20 pts] Question 3.  

# Verify if Python will accept the code below. Explain why or why not.  
                # ‘100’ + 50 
                        
# Make changes if needed and print the result. 


# Let x be ‘2’ and y be 100. 

# Find the product of x and y and let the product have a variable name z. 

# Concatenate it with ' is the same as 2x100.'. 

# Make changes if needed and print the result. 

# Explain what happens if you try to convert the string 'hello' to an integer? (code + written)



# [10 pts] Question 4. 

# Assign the value 25 to a variable called age. 

# Print the value of age. 

# Reassign age to a new value of 'twenty-five' (a string). 

# Print the new value and check its type. 

# How does Python handle changes in variable types? (written)



# [15 pts] Question 5.

# Assign values to three variables a, b, and c in a single line using tuple assignment. 

# Print them in a single line, separated by commas. 

# Print them with custom formatting using the format() method, where a is left-aligned in 10 spaces and b and c are right-aligned in 10 spaces. 

# How does tuple assignment work? (written)



# [15 pts] Question 6.

# Prompt the user to enter their name. Use \n to print a greeting on two lines. 

# Additionally, use \t to print their name indented with a tab. 

# How do control codes like \n and \t change the output formatting? (written)



# [15 pts] Question 7.

# Write a program that asks the user to input two floating-point numbers.  

# Apply addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers.  

# Print the result of each operation after rounding it up to the thousandth place.  

# What happens if the user enters integers instead of decimal numbers? (code + written)
