# Question 1: Division and Remainders

# [10 pts] (Code) 
# Write a program that asks the user to enter three integers. 

# Calculate the sum of the first two numbers. 

# Divide the sum by the third number using integer division (//), floating-point division (/), and find the remainder (%). 

# Print the results.

# [5 pts] (Written) Explain the difference between the //, / and % operators in Python. How would the program behave if the third number were zero?


# Question 2: Order of Operations

# Consider the following expression: 
# result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 6 / 2

# [8 pts] (Code + Written)
# Without running the code, determine the value of result. 
# Then explain the order of operations that Python follows to evaluate this expression. 

# [7 pts] (Code + Written) 
# How would adding parentheses change the result? 
# Show the output for the following: result = (2 + 3) * (4 - 6) / 2


# Question 3: Variable Tracking

# Given the following variables:
# x = 5
# y = 10
# z = x + y
# x = z + 1
# y = x * z

# [5 pts] (Code) What are the values of x, y, and z after the code runs? Print them. 

# [5 pts] (Written) How does variable storage work and and how can losing track of variables cause bugs in more complex programs? 


# Question 4: Unary Operators

# Given the following Python code:
# print(-x + y - z)

# Modify the values of x, y, and z as follows:
# Set x = 10, y = -5, z = -8
# Set x = -10, y = -5, z = 0
# Set x = 0, y = 0, z = -8

# [10 pts] (Code) 
# For each combination, try predicting the output before running the code.
# Then compare your results after running. 

# [5 pts] (Written) Explain the role of the unary operator and how it impacts the values of x, y, and z in these calculations. 


# Question 5: Arithmetic Operations

# [15 pts] (Code) 
# First, prompt the user to input one integer and one floating-point number. 

# Then, perform the following operations:
# Add the two numbers.

# Subtract the floating-point number from the integer.

# Multiply the integer by the floating-point number.

# Divide the floating-point number by the integer.

# Print the type and result for each operation as an f-string. 


# Question 6: .format() Method with Single-Line Strings (Part 1)

# [7 pts] (Code) 
# Use the .format() method to print the message: 
# "My name is <your name> and I am <your age> years old."

# [3 pts] (Written) Name up to 3 reasons why using .format() method makes the code more readable compared to concatenating strings with +?


# Question 7: .format() Method with Multi-Line Strings (Part 2)

# [15 pts] (Code) 
# Write a Python program that asks user input for two questions:
# Why they are taking the course?
# What interests them most about Python? 
# Use a multi-line string with triple quotes to display their answers in the following format:

# My Course Reflection
# I'm taking this course because: <user answer>
# What excites me most about learning Python is: <user answer>

# [5 pts] (Written) What benefits can you observe from using triple quotes instead of adding \n at every line?
